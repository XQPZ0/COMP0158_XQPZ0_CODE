# COMP0158_XQPZ0_CODE

This repository contains all the data and code for candidate XQPZ0's MSc DSML thesis with UCL. All data files are in Apache Parquet format. All code is provided in commented and structure Jupyter Notebooks.

The contents of each folder are described here:

- **Chapter 3**: Contains the initial full HFEA dataset along with all preprocessing and exploratory data analysis code documented in _Chapter 3_ of the report.
- **Chapter 4**: Contains the train and test datasets along with all the code for the baseline models (single-stage models and multistage models leveraging unsupervised learning). The results of these models, recorded in the Notebook are detailed in _Chapter 4_ of the report.
- **Chapters 5 & 6**: Contains two Jupyter Notebooks, one per novel cascade architecture: Cascade #1 and Cascade #2, along with the same train and test datasets as previously. The Jupyter Notebooks contain all results documented and discussed in _Chapters 5 & 6_ of the report.
- **Chapter 7**: Contains the initial full HFEA dataset, the preprocessing code for this experimentation stage, along with a Notebook containing all experiments and results for this section. THe results obtained here are presented in _Chapter 7_ of the report.
