- **'FRESH_FROZEN_2016.parquet'**: Contains the preprocessed data from 2016 with both 'fresh' and 'frozen' cycles.
- **EDA.ipynb**: Contains all preprocessing and exploratory data analysis code documented in _Chapter 3_ of the report.
- **BASELINES.ipynb**: Contains the code and results for all baseline models (single-stage models and multistage models leveraging unsupervised learning), documented in _Chapter 4_ of the report.
- **'CASCADE_#1.ipynb**: Contains the code and results for Cascade #1, documented in _Chapters 5 & 6_ of the report.
- **'CASCADE_#2.ipynb**: Contains the code and results for Cascade #2, documented in _Chapters 5 & 6_ of the report.
- **'EXP_PROCESSOR.ipynb'**: Contains the code to preprocess the data from 2006 to 2016 for the purpose of future experiments.
